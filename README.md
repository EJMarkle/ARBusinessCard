# ðŸ’¼ Evan Markle - Augmented Reality Business Card

This project is a mobile-friendly augmented reality business card built with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) and [MindAR](https://hiukim.github.io/mind-ar-js-doc/). When users point their phone camera at a printed target (a qr code), interactive 3D buttons appear, linking to my professional profiles and contact info.

## ðŸ“± Features

- Mobile-first AR experience powered by MindAR
- Tap-based raycasting to open links on mobile
- Fully responsive UI with a startup modal for instructions
- Polished UI and animations for interactive 3D models
